## Overview of the Project

In this project, City Bikesharing data from August, 2019 was analyzed and visualized to show data about bike utilization. 

## Results

The first line chart shows Checkout Times among all users. The majority of trips are shorter than 1 hour. The peak trip duration was 5 minutes (146,752 rides). See figure 1.

The second line chart shows Checkout Times parsed out by Gender. The majority of trips were also shorter than 1 hour. The peak trip duration for males was 5 minutes (108,087 rides). The peak trip duration for females was 6 minutes (34,151 rides). The peak trip duration for unknown gender was 11 minutes (7,389 rides). See figure 2.

The third graph (heat map) shows the peak times for each day of the week. Weekdays "rushhour" times (6 - 9 AM & 4 - 8 PM) were the most popular, with Thursdays being the most popular day of the week. Weekdays also saw peak usage around lunch time (11 AM - 2 PM). See figure 3.

The fourth graph (heat map) shows the peak times for each day of the week, divided by gender. Males and females showed similar usage trends as in the previous chart, with males showing greater usage on weekdays and weekends. See figure 4.

The fifth graph shows the most popular days of the week, separated by user class and gender. Subscribers used the bikesharing service more than non-subscribers, and males used the service more than females. Thursdays were the most popular days of the week for Subscribers (male or female), while weekends were more popular than weekdays for non-subscribers. See figure 5.

The sixth image shows the most popular starting locations in NYC. The lower west side of Manhattan had the highest number of starting rides. See figure 6.

The seventh image shows the most popular starting locations in NYC, with median household incomes overlayed. Areas with lower household income tend to show less bike usage as compared to areas with higher median household incomes. See figure 7.

## Summary and Analysis
The data shows that male subscribers are primary users of the bikesharing platform. The afternoon rushhour on Thursdays was the most popular time for subscribers, followed by other weekday rushhour times. Non-subscribers primarily use the bikesharing service on weekends. This indicates that subscribers primarily use the bikesharing service as their main means of transportation to-and-from work, while non-subscribers primarily use the bikesharing service for leisure on the weekends. 
Lower Manhattan was the most popular are for bikers.

Additionally, I would recommend a chart displaying top starting locations overlayed with housing data to show what relationships, if any, exist between starting location and housing density. I would also recommend a chart displaying top starting locations overlayed with race/ethnicity data to show what relationships exist between race and bike usage.
