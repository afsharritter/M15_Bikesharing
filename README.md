In this project, City Bikesharing data from August, 2019 was analyzed and visualized to show data about bike utilization. 

## Results

The third graph (heat map) shows the peak times for each day of the week. Weekdays "rushhour" times (6 - 9 AM & 4 - 8 PM) were the most popular, with Thursdays being the most popular day of the week. Weekdays also saw peak usage around lunch time (11 AM - 2 PM). See figure 3.

The fourth graph (heat map) shows the peak times for each day of the week, divided by gender. Males and females showed similar usage trends as in the previous chart, with males showing greater usage on weekdays and weekends. See figure 4.

The fifth graph shows the most popular days of the week, separated by user class and gender. Subscribers used the bikesharing service more than non-subscribers, and males used the service more than females. Thursdays were the most popular days of the week for Subscribers (male or female), while weekends were more popular than weekdays for non-subscribers. See figure 5.
